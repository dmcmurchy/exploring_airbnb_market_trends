containing data on Airbnb listing prices and locations.\n","- **`listing_id`**: unique identifier of listing\n","- **`price`**: nightly listing price in USD\n","- **`nbhood_full`**: name of borough

unique identifier of listing\n","- **`description`**: listing description\n","- **`room_type`**: Airbnb has three types of rooms: shared rooms, private rooms, and entire
